With software, can we solve a jigsaw puzzle? 

Some questions this project is experimenting with solving:

Main goal: Given a collection of puzzle pieces, could we solve the puzzle? 
Secondary goal: Can we write AI to pick up pieces from an unsorted pile, sort them and place them in a sorted pile?
Secondary goal: Create a simulation in Unity3d to visualize the puzzle solving process.
